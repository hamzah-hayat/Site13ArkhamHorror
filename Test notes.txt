Hide card names when mouse over

Post game discussion:

suggestion: enemies that spawn more of themselves? 

Spawn at an empty location Hunter enemy

Retaliate on odd amount of doom on puppetbox

General increase enemy health, fight, damage and horror

make runestone 2 damage 2 horror eg











miltary personnel act 1a

Runestone should be at least evens after research (skill test)

the combiner "play area"
sum of the cost of the discarded cards
colon for cost

Guard -> nearest storage location


Add "monster" to entities


patrol location with a spider enemy

Act 2a, no Elite enemies
Act 3, no Elite enemies


the vending machine research, do all three actions for 3 resources

research archive add Research

combine effects heart chamber 4 will power check

paralysing venom, at the end of your next turn

change power generator on last floor


stalker reduce evasion until end of round





you cannot attack this enemy stalker etc 

make another way to get items, make items more impactful and generic


remove breaking containment, just have one entity on top floor, two medium floor, 1 bottom floor
